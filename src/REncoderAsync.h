 *   When dealing with computers and DirectX events, some time is required
 *  to pass between the "press" and "release" events in order for the
 *  computer to correctly process the event.
 *   This library adds a counter _NumEvents to the update() method to keep the
 *  number of events that still need to be sent out while timing the correct
 *  time separation through getEvent() method.
 *   When a step to the opposite side to the events in the queue is received,
 *  the number of pending events is reduced instead of adding a new one
 *  to the opposite side.
 *   A boolean _NextEventRelease keeps track of a pending release event even
 *  when _NumEvents changes sign (encoder direction).
 *   Convention: clockwise (CW) events are positive in sign, while
 *  counterclockwise (CCW) events are negative. This is also followed in
 *
